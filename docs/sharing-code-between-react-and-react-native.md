# How to share code between React and React Native.

There are a couple ways to share code between React and React Native apps.

1. Use WebViews
2. Use React Native Web
3. Use React With Native
4. Webviews

Advantage: fast to implement, 1:1 similarity.

Disadvantage: slow, non-native ux

2. React Native Web

Advantage: 1 codebase, still quite fast to implement

Disadvantage: many react native components are not supported, many html stuff is not supported in those components like View, and you still need to write HTML for that, you need to start with a html codebase, but most companies start with a react codebase.

3. React with native

Advantage: no limitations: you use a separate react and react native project but you share code between them using a private package. All html elements still exist and can be used in react native, all react native components still exist and can be used in react.

Disadvantage: takes more time to implement because you have 2 codebases, but this is mainly because there are key differences that need to be implemented separately anyway and because you donâ€™t want to bundle unneeded stuff. The rest (>95%) of the code is shared still!
