/**
 * Creates a `MappedObject` of an array of any type. `MappedObject`s are great for increasing efficiency to get an item from an array. Especially useful when finds are needed on a specific key match for huge arrays. Instead of finding on the array you can simply get the right property from this object.
 *
 * NB: Don't use this inside of render functions, it's a very slow function, the whole idea is that this makes it faster, so just do it once!
