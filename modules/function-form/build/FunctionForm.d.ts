FunctionForm is a very easy way to create a frontend component that is connected with an api that is connected with a function on your backend (that can do anything)

All you need to provide is a `TsFunction`

This component only works if your `api` is up-to-date and your function is succesfully indexed using `typerepo`. For authentication, the `api` convention is used. See the `api` docs.
