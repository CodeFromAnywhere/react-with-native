# Function form

function-form (`OperationClassification` ui-cjs)

Component that lets you easily create a frontend form for any function in your project (both backend and frontend functions)




# Api reference

## `<FunctionForm />`

FunctionForm is a very easy way to create a frontend component that is connected with an api that is connected with a function on your backend (that can do anything)

All you need to provide is a `TsFunction`

This component only works if your `api` is up-to-date and your function is succesfully indexed using `typerepo`. For authentication, the `api` convention is used. See the `api` docs.

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** | `JSX.Element`   |    |
