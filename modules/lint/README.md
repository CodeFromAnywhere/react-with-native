# Lint

lint (`OperationClassification` node-cjs)



# Api reference

## preIndexLint()

Should be a collection of small functions that check if all conventions are used and if there isn't used anything that should NOT be used. this can later become a linter. make sure to research how eslint works first

Plan:

1) just use my own sdk's as much as possible to provide some handy convention checks in a package
2) later integrate this into vscode, i'm sure this is how it's done

this lint can be done before indexation

} | { operationFolderPath: string, <br /> } |  |
