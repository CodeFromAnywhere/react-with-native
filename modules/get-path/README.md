# Get path

get-path (js operation)

Useful functions to get paths within King OS.

Depends on `sdk-operations`, which makes it only work inside of a typerepo.




# Api reference

## getProjectRoot()

returns project root folder path

recursive. goes up until it finds a folder that's the project root

if no source path is given, uses the directory name where the function is executed from as a starting point


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| fullSourcePath (optional) | string |  |
| **Output** | string   |    |



## ðŸ“„ getProjectRoot (exported const)

returns project root folder path

recursive. goes up until it finds a folder that's the project root

if no source path is given, uses the directory name where the function is executed from as a starting point


## findOperationBasePath()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| startPath | string |  |
| **Output** | string   |    |



## getOperationPath()

Gets a path of any operation in the project

TODO: IDEA: maybe auto-generate key-value JSON where keys are the package-names of all operations and values are paths of their locations in the file system. we can easily generate this ourselves, but maybe it's also easy to use the npm yarn workspace for this, although it may not be available in all circumstances, so better not rely on it. The advantage of this would be that this function becomes sync and is much more efficient. The disadvantage is that every time you move something or add something new, this indexation has to happen, otherwise it fails.


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| operationName | string | specify the operation folder name |,| config (optional) | { manualProjectRoot?: string, <br />notUseSdk?: boolean, <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |

## getOperationPathParse()

get all operation-related path information that can be inferred from the path

NB: currently it also looks up the operation name from its packagejson
