## ai/free-docs/README.md

Welcome to this document in which I present my personal findings, learnings, observations, thoughts, theories, and everything related to language models and AI.

I'm Wijnand, currently all in on researching ChatGPT and building the future with it. There will be a premium variant of these tips soon, see you in the community.

Enjoy!

## ai/free-docs/applications/README.md

It's clear that this new technology is a revolutionary one for **human machine communication**.

It's also clear that it's going to be applied across all industries that are at least somewhat digital.

I want to share an **industry-agnostic** perspective on this new technology:

- personalisation
- inter-disiplinary integration of knowledge
- removing the education-work barrier
- removing the creator-consumer barrier
- removing the langauge barrier
- human-machine communication
- human-human communication
- machine-machine communication

I also want to share my perspective on the dangers of this new technology:

- human isolation
- selfish technology as a medium for human-human communication
- explosive energy consumption
- indulging parallel realities and belief systems (black rabbit holes you're sucked into and can't get out)
- brainwashing, mind control
- ai dictator

I also want to propose some ideas for solutions to the above dangers, we can implement into our products:

- human-centered product design
- self-governance
- purpose driven thinking
- avoiding human-ai lock-in (dependency on ai)

I also came up with some standards to live by to prevent personal harm of this new technology, see the productivity section.

<!-- TODO: expand all these ideas -->

## ai/free-docs/applications/job-transfer.md

# Job transfer: from Human workers to AI Workers

Definitions:

> **physical worker**: A worker that has a job that has one or more obligatory requirements of exersizing the job in a physical environement with or without physical tools. For example, a hairdresser needs to see people in person in order to cut their hair. It needs to use tools to do presice actions in time and space.

> **non-physical worker**: A worker that has a job that has no requirement to be practiced in a physical way. For example, a programmer that works remotely is doing all is work by inputting his output into a computer system, and communicating with others inside of the digital realm.

> **digital job**: A worker that is doing a job that is completely done in a digital environment. The difference with the **non-physical worker** is limited, but the difference is that the digital job omits the responsibility to ever go out of the digital realm.

> **human worker**: A worker that is doing either physical work or non-phyisical work, or both.

> **ai worker**: A worker that is doing just digital work. It is not capable of the physical part, unless there are very good robot machines that can operate in this environment in a competitive manner.

So... GPT3.5 just came out. After brainstorming and experimenting for over 24 hours, I hypothise now that we can replace a lot of human workers by ai workers, very soon. When I say "a lot" I mean 100% of non-physical workers. When I say soon I mean within a year, we just need to create some good tools for it.

What needs to happen? It can be summarised by these things:

- multi-modal entity interaction (communication with digital sources as well as human workers)
- proactivity (capability to proactively do work)
- domain knowledge (enough training data to understand problems thoroughly)
- policies (rules and constraints for the ai worker to adhere to)
- context (knowing the landscape and context of the job: who/what can be interacted with, which documents are available, etc)
- tentacles (access to the landscape of different actions that can be taken to interact with the context)

All of this together will enable language models like **ChatGPT** to replace human workers across all industries. Obviously this is incredibly interesting since AI Workers currenlty cost at least 2 to 4 orders of magnitudes less compared to the human workers. If a human digital worker would earn 2000 euros in a month, its ai worker counterpart could probably do the same thing for maximum 100 euros.

## When is it coming?

I foresee that there are going to be a lot of startups with more and more "AI workers". Especially once the language models become truly multi-modal, it is going to be capable to go completely closed-loop, that is, without human middle-men.

In the coming years, digital startups and big tech companies alike will replace more and more of the human productivity with ai producivity, until that percentage is very high, and the company can basically be ran without humans. Depending on how many people open their eyes high in the company hierarchy, this could take anywhere between a couple years and 50 years, or maybe a century. Of course, I assume here that we WANT this. If we don't, we might go in a completely different direction.

In the long run, I this means **human workers** become irrelevant to the equation of running any successful business in the digital realm. In the short term, this means the whole landscape of digital work is going to be increasingly more aggressive and competitive. It means that companies who don't adapt will have a harder and harder time to compete.

## What can a company do to adapt?

To adapt your business to be prepared to the shift in workforces, I came up with these things:

1. **Embrace AI tooling**

2. **Educate human workers**

3. **Move from non-physical to digital**

4. **Map out your domain knowledge, policies, context, and tentacles**

5. **Hire an AI company to create these AI workers and integrate them into your setting**

I gave my article to the AI and he summarised it like this:

As AI technology continues to advance, there is a growing potential for AI workers to replace human workers in non-physical jobs. This shift could lead to significant cost savings for companies, as AI workers are typically significantly cheaper than their human counterparts. In order to prepare for this shift, companies should embrace AI tooling, educate their human workers, and move from non-physical to digital work. Additionally, they should map out their domain knowledge, policies, context, and tentacles in order to effectively integrate AI workers into their operations. Hiring an AI company to assist with this process can also be beneficial.

> Disclaimer: I've written this quite early after ChatGPT and when I was in a rush, I said it might take mere years to reach this. I now know there are subtleties that need to be solved first and this will probably take a little longer, nevertheless I think this is where it might be going!

## ai/free-docs/applications/target-audience.md

I think that up until now startups have been building products for humans. I think that from now on, startups should design startups to be used by both humans and machines. I think it's much better to create a general purpose way for AI's to interact with your system, instead of integrating it yourself with a couple of them. If the API is public and accessible for AI, as much as it is for users, it's going to be very easy for future language models and you'll already have "integration" for them without coding anything.

For this I've come up with the **hierarchical action tree** and many other ideas. I'll ellaborate on this further in the future.

## ai/free-docs/getting-started.md

Because it's just an API, you can build things with ChatGPT with any techstack. However, I am opinionated, and I recommend Typescript (Node.js, Next.js, and React) because I built a way to build full stack apps with that super quickly (see typerepo.com) and I've started with a course about it (see codefromanywhere.com)

To get started with ChatGPT, there are many ways:

1. Use chat.openai.com manually. Not recommended
2. Use the reverse-engineered API you can find open source on GitHub
3. Use the browser-automation library you can find open source on GitHub
4. Use typerepo's ChatGPT integration you can find open source on GitHub (this one already has the capability to store your prompts and prompt results in a database!)

The 3 latter ones can make you get started in a more controlled environment: you can build your own user interfaces on top of ChatGPT with React (or any other framework).

Please DM me on Discord for the most recent links to these GitHub libraries.

## ai/free-docs/modern-rethoric/context.md

There's many ways to provide context to a system.

- providing datasets
- providing texts
- providing code
- file contents
- selection of file contents
- multiple files (or indexes thereof)

It has great implications on the result!

## ai/free-docs/modern-rethoric/preventing-halicunation.md

Hallicunation occurs when a language model does not have enough information, and yet thinks it knows enough.

Some ideas on how to prevent it:

1. Tell the model to be more careful

2. Tell the model to only use certain context, and not anything else it thinks it knows.

3. Specifically ask the model to leave out specific details.

4. Fact-check the generated information against the internet.

## ai/free-docs/modern-rethoric/prompt-secrets/README.md

I have experimented a lot lately, and came up with some very interestig prompting techniques. This is availble in the deluxe pdf I'm preparing. Ask your company to pay for it!

## ai/free-docs/modern-rethoric/splitting.md

It helps a lot if you don't ask too many questions at once to the language model. If you have a hard problem to solve, think about how you would do it yourself, or ask it how it would solve the problem first. You can then execute on this plan step by step by asking every step individually, prompt by promopt.

Programmers also split up their issues into smaller pieces first before they begin, and for language models you should use a similar technique!

Newer models might be different, but if you ask too big questions, ChatGPT isn't capable of answering because it's reasoning capabilities don't go that far yet.

## ai/free-docs/prompt-engineering.md

There are going to be many roles for prompt engineering. The hard part about prompt engineering is that, often, you need to understand the actual thing that is should replace.

- marketing prompt engineer
- product owner prompt engineer
- developer prompt engineer
- psychologist prompt engineer
- rapper prompt engineer
- comedian prompt engineer
- business prompt engineer
- x advisor prompt engineer
- x teacher prompt engineer

You name it. In order to write good prompts, you have to have a deep understand of the way these people work, of the field, and of the market.

(You might be able to write some good prompts to get the information above though 😉 consider the "prompt engineer prompt engineer")

I think today, everyone that knows about ChatGPT should switch from their profession P to a new profession "P prompt engineer". This will definitely be a good position to be in right now.
