Welcome to Typebase. Typebase is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) that lets you create a database with models that are stored on the file system in multiple formats, that are easy to understand and well structured.

> Object Relational Mapping: A mapping from stored data to set of functions that can access that stored data in a specific programming language.

Typebase is very well integrated with Typescript, which makes it very easy to create new models that are typesafe.

> typesafe: the types of requested data are given without accessing the information itself. This makes it much harder to make mistakes in your code, because you know the shape of your data that you are going to request.
