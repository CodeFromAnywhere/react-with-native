Typebase has some limitations, compared to other databases like MySQL or PostGres.

# performance and scalability

The performance and scalability is not great. It is not the main usecase of typebase to have giant databases with models with millions of rows.

# concurrency

Currently, Typebase doesn't support concurrency, but it is easy to add so we'll do that in the future.
