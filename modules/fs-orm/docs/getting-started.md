To get started with `fs-orm`, please have a look at the `db` package. This package shows you how to initiate a database object.

It is using a package `sdk-db` which you can create yourself (or generate, based on the models found in your monorepo)

From there, it's very easy to use fs-orm. For example, if you want to get all the `Todo` values, simply use something like this

```ts
const todos = await db.get("Todo");
```

Check the `createDb` function to see the exact type definition of all the function on the db-object. Otherwise you can just use Intellisense for it, you can easily understand everything that way.
