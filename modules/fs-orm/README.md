# Fs orm

fs-orm (`OperationClassification` node-cjs)

ORM that lets you create a database with models that are stored on the file system in multiple formats that are easy to understand and well structured.




# Api reference

## ðŸ”¹ CustomQueryConfig

NB: the dbStorageMethod cannot be specified here because this is a static configuration per db-model and cannot be specified on a per-query basis.

Also you can't specify projectRelativePath and operationRelativePath. It should not be needed, you should specify the db storage locations in the createDb config.

Properties: 

 | Name | Type | Description |

## getDatabaseFiles()

This function gets the files that the data can be stored, by convention, based on the model and the config

Only returns the file paths that actually exist.

CONVENTION:

When searching for data, `fs-orm` will look in:
- `db/` in your project root
- `db/` in any operation

In these folders, `fs-orm` will search for files based on your storage method.
@see DbStorageMethod for more info

Returns not only the file paths, but also where they were found (`operationName, projectRelativePath, operationRelativePath`)

## getDbFileLocation()

Used by `groupByFile`, which is used for `set` (and thus, also `update`) and `upsert`: determines the new file location.

Applies the convention to get the db-file-location of an item

Based on the merged config:

- if `operationRelativePath` is specified, gets a filePath in the operation
- if `projectRelativePath` is specified, gets a filepath in the project
- otherwise gets the pattern and replaces "*" with the slug (or id if slug is not available)

Besides the absolute path, the operationName, projectRelativePath and operationRelativePath are also supplied.

NB: currently, the item's `operationName`, `operationRelativePath` or `projectRelativePath` is not taken into account. It will simply look at the convention to see where it should be saved, and apply the MergedQueryConfig...


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| storedItem | `Storing<AugmentedAnyModelType>` | The ModelLocation properties in the item are completely ignored.

Only the ID, slug and categoryStackCalculated are used to determine the exact file the item should be stored in.

NB: storedItem MUST have a slug or ID, but this should probably be generated before this funciton |,| operationName | null | Should be the operationName from the modellocation of the actual item.

If it is given, this will take priority over the merged query config. |,| mergedConfig | `MergedQueryConfig` |  |,| modelName | string |  |

2) referenced data is omitted
3) calculated data is omitted

Takes stored data and an item

- updates the data and sets some rows to "item" if the item is found (through the slug). this works almost the same as the regular upsert function

BEWARE:

- the categoryStackCalculated must be existing in the markdownfile.
- you cannot insert a header, always insert an item with `isHeaderCalculated:false`

Safely gets the length of something


## ðŸ“„ getLocationPattern (exported const)

Returns the pattern or an exact relative path that the file(s) should be stored at.

If a pattern contains a star at the place of the filename, it will search the folder recursively for all files with the extension in the pattern.

Returning relative path has no preceding slash


## ðŸ“„ getMergedConfigOperationPath (exported const)

NB: returns 3 things:
- false: no operation path
- undefined: operation path undefined
- path: the specific operation path


## ðŸ“„ getParentSlug (exported const)

get a parent slug without the parent_xxxSlug reference (uses the categoryStackCalculated)

can be undefined if the item has no parent


## ðŸ“„ getRootFolders (exported const)

Gets all root folders where db folders can be located inside of

NB: Before november '22, this function is quite slow if it needs to find all operation folders becuase this takes at least 60ms.


## ðŸ“„ getWildcardDbFileLocations__OLD (exported const)

If it all seems good, I can delete this. This is the old method of looking just in the folder itself, it's replaced by looking in all subfolders as well, recursively.


## ðŸ“„ getWildcardDbFileLocations (exported const)

## ðŸ“„ groupByFile (exported const)

Used for `set` and `upsert`. Groups creation items into an object where keys are file paths and values are items that need to be stored


## ðŸ“„ makeStoringItem (exported const)

Three things need to happen in order to store an item

1) keys that can be inferred from the file path are omitted
2) referenced data is omitted
3) calculated data is omitted


## ðŸ“„ maxQueryTimeSeconds (exported const)

## ðŸ“„ removeKeyValueMarkdown (exported const)

Takes stored data and a slug to remove


## ðŸ“„ removeMultiple (exported const)

Function that lets you remove items from one specific file, for any storage method


## ðŸ“„ upsertItems (exported const)

upsert an item into storage in any storage method


## ðŸ“„ upsertKeyValueMarkdown (exported const)

Takes stored data and an item

- updates the data and sets some rows to "item" if the item is found (through the slug). this works almost the same as the regular upsert function

- otherwise inserts, at the right category, in the right place in the array

BEWARE:

- the categoryStackCalculated must be existing in the markdownfile.
- you cannot insert a header, always insert an item with `isHeaderCalculated:false`


## ðŸ“„ waitForLockfile (exported const)
