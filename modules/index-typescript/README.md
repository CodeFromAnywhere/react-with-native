  In order to sort the indexed types well, you need to know that:

1. Interfaces first index all extended types and interfaces, then the interface itself. The last extended type/inteface comes first, then the previous one, etc.

2. If you define an intersection type (e.g. `type X = A & { someObject: string } & B;`), the last intersected item comes first, the first item comes last in the order. This gives you more flexibility because in an interface the extended things always come b efore, but with a type they can also come in the middle. If you do this for a model, be sure to add the `dbStorageMethod` in frontmatter manually

## Example:

Let's say you want to define a special type of user, which is a user but has an additional mapped object type, which you want behind in the order. But you want the main properties of the slug at the beginning...

You can then choose to do it somewhat like this:

```ts
export type SpecialUser = MappedObjectType & {
  username: string;
  password: string;
} & SlugModelType;
```

This way the `SlugModelType` properties come first in the indexation, then the username and password, and then the `MappedObjectType`.

**Conclusion**: If you're making a type that extends multiple things, but the order should be more custom, use a `type` instead of an `interface`.

## generateSchema()

If existing schema is not stale, just require it.
Otherwise, generate it for a file

NB: The `createGenerator` function finds also imported TsInterfaces, which leads to duplicate TsInterfaces. With pushing the interfaces to the slug filename, this is no problem though, there should not be any duplication!


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| filePath | string |  |,| morphInterfaceInfo | `MorphInterfaceInfo`[] |  |,| namedAbsoluteImportNames | string[] |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getAllComments()

gets all leading comments and trailing comments raw text, put together, separated with newlines


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** | {  }[]   |    |



## getDbStorageMethod()

Gets db storage method for indexation

1) Frontmatter overrules everything
2) Special extensions are looked at


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| config | { typeName: string, <br />frontmatter: `Frontmatter`, <br />extensions?: string[], <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getFrontmatterDbStorageMethod()

if isDbModel is specifically set to false, this will return null (which means this should overwrite other things)


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| parameters | {  } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getFrontmatterFunctionParameters()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** | { runEveryPeriod: {  }, <br />isApiExposed: boolean, <br /> }   |    |



## getMaxIndentationDepth()

gets the maximum indentation depth of any piece of code

does this simply by splitting up the piece of code into lines and checking the indentation of every line, finding the highest one.

assumes an indentation contains 2 spaces.


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionText | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getMinMaxValidation()

| **Output** | {  }   |    |



## getParamSchema()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getParametersFromInterfaces()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionName | string |  |,| interfaces | `Creation<TsInterface>`[] | NB: we need ALL interfaces here across the project because there may be others that were not found in the interfaces in the file, but only in the functions. |
| **Output** | {  }[]   |    |



## getPossibleRefs()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| interfaces | `Creation<TsInterface>`[] |  |
| **Output** | { name: string, <br />schema: {  }, <br /> }[]   |    |



## getSizeSummary()

takes a string and simply returns the amount of characters, the amount of lines and the amount of bytes

TODO: this is not the right place for this function


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| string | string |  |
| **Output** | { numberOfFiles?: number, <br />characters: number, <br />lines: number, <br />bytes: number, <br />linesPerFile: number, <br />charactersPerLine: number, <br />bytesPerCharacter: number, <br /> }   |    |



## getSpecialExtensionDbStorageMethod()

returns undefined if there is not a special extension. if there is, it returns the dbStorageMethod


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| extensions (optional) | string[] |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getTsStatements()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getTypeInfo()

takes a ts morph type and returns all info about it

if available, a schema should be provided about the type because it's hard to infer it (probably buggy)


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** | { typeDefinition?: {  }, <br />simplifiedSchema?: {  }, <br />isObject: boolean, <br />isArray: boolean, <br />isPrimitive: boolean, <br />isEnum: boolean, <br />isEnumLiteral: boolean, <br />typeCoverage: number, <br />rawType: string, <br /> }   |    |



## getValidatedOperationPathParse()

| **Output** |    |    |

| ---------- | -- | -- |
| maybeInterface | `MaybeInteface` |  |
| **Output** | {  }   |    |



## hasTypescriptFileChanged()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| eventName | `WatchEventType` |  |,| path | string |  |
| **Output** | {  }   |    |



## indexImportsExportsForFilePath()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** |    |    |



## indexTypescriptFilePath()

Index a single typescript file


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** |    |    |



## indexTypescriptFile()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| project | `Project` |  |,| file | `CompleteOperationPathParse` |  |,| projectRoot | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## indexTypescript()

Creates a typescript file index in 3 steps
1) Introspects the file
2) Calculates all needed information about it
3) Saves the result to /db/******.json in the operation root

NB: Build errors are done separately as this is done operation-wide, everything else is done for each file

NB: I don't think this is super efficient, because the project is taken to just index a single file. It's probably better to pass the project and the sourcefile in here, right?

TODO: if a typescript file starst with a comment before any statements (but possibly after the `#!/usr/bin/env xyz` statement), this should be indexed as the main file comment... This can be shown when opening the file in the admin... It should also check if there is an associated md file for that in src, so that can also be added in the index.


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| props | { showLogging?: boolean, <br />filePaths: string[], <br />manualProjectRoot: string, <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## isPrimitive()

export const getDefinitions = () => definitions;

export const getClass = (name) => allClasses[name];


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** | {  }   |    |



## makeTsComment()

this is actually a fundamental part of the OS. How should comments be structured?

I think, in general, that we should make it look as much as possible at markdown, because it should always be able to have markdown anyway.


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| config | { operationRelativeTypescriptFilePath: string, <br />commentRange: `CommentRange`, <br />statementName?: string, <br />rawStatement: string, <br />fileContent: string, <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## removeTypescriptIndex()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** |    |    |



## schemaToTsInterface()

make a tsInterface from a schema generated from the file


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| filePath | string |  |,| typeName | string |  |,| schema | `Schema` |  |,| morphInterfaceInfo (optional) | `MorphInterfaceInfo` |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## tryCreateSchema()

Try because sometimes generateSchema fails


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| config | `Config` |  |
| **Output** | { schema?: {  }, <br />error?: string, <br /> }   |    |



## typeToSchema()

calculates the schema of a type

this is great for types inside of parameters of variables that are not declared separately, however, it's probably not as good as vega's json schema generator... therefore, it would be great to always prefer vega's way above this.

NB: this method throws sometimes if it can't find some stuff, so make sure to try/catch it.
