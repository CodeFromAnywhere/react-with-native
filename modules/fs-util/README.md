# Fs util

fs-util (js operation)

General purpose wrapper around `node:fs` and `node:path` that should be used instead of those, because it removes some of its painpoints, removes unneeded stuff, and adds some other useful functions.




# Api reference

## ðŸ“„ path (exported const)

## ðŸ“„ fs (exported const)

NB: for some reason some of the graceful-fs functions aren't complete. For example, I can't seem to copy folders with cp from graceful-fs (cp)

For that one I added cpAsync.


## getLastFolder()

removes everything after the last slash to get folder path

input: /Users/king/Documents/some/folder/xyz
output: xyz

input: /Users/king/Documents/some/folder/xyz.txt
output: folder

## getFolder()

if the path exists:

- if the pathstring is not a folder, returns the pathstring without the file suffix

if the path doesn't exist: returns pathString witout last chunk (this would only work for file paths)
