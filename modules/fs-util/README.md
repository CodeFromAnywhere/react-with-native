# Fs util

fs-util (js operation)

General purpose wrapper around `node:fs` and `node:path` that should be used instead of those, because it removes some of its painpoints, removes unneeded stuff, and adds some other useful functions.




# Api reference

## ðŸ“„ path (exported const)

## ðŸ“„ fs (exported const)

NB: for some reason some of the graceful-fs functions aren't complete. For example, I can't seem to copy folders with cp from graceful-fs (cp)

For that one I added cpAsync.


## getLastFolder()

removes everything after the last slash to get folder path

input: /Users/king/Documents/some/folder/xyz

## ðŸ”¹ Path

unlike PathLike, this is only a string

For now, we don't have a clear convention whether or not this string should be absolute or anything.

## getFolder()

if the path exists:
- if the pathString is a folder, that is returned.
- if the pathstring is not a folder, returns the pathstring without the file suffix

if the path doesn't exist: returns pathString witout last chunk (this would only work for file paths)


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| pathString | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## ðŸ“„ getFolder (exported const)

## getAllFoldersUntilFolder()

NB: I already have this somewhere else but couldn't find it!

If the path is /a/random/path

| ---------- | -- | -- |
| folderPath | string |  |
| **Output** | string[]   |    |



## removeAllExcept()

Removes everything inside a folder except some files and folders that can, optionally, be ignored for removal. does not remove the folder itself

NB: make this work with subdirectories!

| ---------- | -- | -- |
| folderPath | string |  |,| config (optional) | { ignore?: string[], <br />typeToRemove?: file / folder, <br /> } |  |
