/**
 * this function does the same as kebabCase but it also does some more transformation on top
 *
 * useful for making simple URLs and filenames. Kebacase is not enough
 *
 * NB: this is no two way transformation. When slugifying something, information is lost and it cannot be converted back in the original name.
 *
 * TODO: make the tranformations that are done here into smaller util functions and make a clean function that can be ran before running every casing conversion (maybe in a config)
