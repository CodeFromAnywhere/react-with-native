# Server login

server-login (`OperationClassification` node-cjs)

This operation exposes rudimentary functions to set cookies from the backend. We require cookies in order to authenticate a user for GET requests. Cookies are sent to the server for every request and are a safer way, because they are not part of the URL that can be found in the browser history.

This thing is far from finished, see `todo/` for what needs to be done.

| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## loginWithPasswordWithContext()

Login with username and password

1. Adds an username/password combo as auth-method to the device,
2. Checks the persons to match the auth
3. In case of match, moves the method to the person and connects the device

## removeDeviceAuthenticationMethodWithContext()

removes an `authenticatedMethod` from `Device`

Usually the authentication methods are an attempt to login into a new account, so if you remove something it doesnt have impact on the accounts you already logged into, because these authentications are not stored on the device but on the person.

We can therefore remove it without much validation


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| method | `AuthenticationMethodMethod` |  |
| **Output** |    |    |

- Function is wrappable


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| personData | `SignupPersonData` | Data required for creating a `Person`. Can be filled in by the user partly, but also partly automatically |
| **Output** |    |    |



## signupWithPasswordWithContext()

For now only username/pass is supported due to direct verification

This function makes an authenticationmethod for the device and then signs up by creating a person for it and attaching it to the device.


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| fullName | string |  |,| username | string |  |,| pictureImage (optional) | `BackendAsset` |  |,| password | string |  |,| repeatPassword | string |  |
