# Server login

server-login (`OperationClassification` node-cjs)

This operation exposes rudimentary functions to set cookies from the backend. We require cookies in order to authenticate a user for GET requests. Cookies are sent to the server for every request and are a safer way, because they are not part of the URL that can be found in the browser history.

This thing is far from finished, see `todo/` for what needs to be done.

This overwrites the public authorisation.


### Editing api availability

By default, every exported backend function will become available through the api after indexation of the operation and generating the SDK.

If you want to disable that for a function, you can do so by disabling it altogether, by adding this parameter into your frontmatter.

```ts
/**
---
isApiExposed: false
---

*/
const yourFunction = () => void

## ðŸ“„ isValidPassword (exported const)

# Internal

Login with username and password

1. Adds an username/password combo as auth-method to the device,
2. Checks the persons to match the auth
3. In case of match, moves the method to the person and connects the device


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| username | string |  |,| password | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## logoutWithContext()

Uses cookies (https://serverjs.io/documentation/reply/#cookie-) to logout

Needed for having `authToken` with GET as well in a safe manner (e.g. for images)


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| rememberAuthentication (optional) | boolean |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## removeDeviceAuthenticationMethodWithContext()

removes an `authenticatedMethod` from `Device`

Usually the authentication methods are an attempt to login into a new account, so if you remove something it doesnt have impact on the accounts you already logged into, because these authentications are not stored on the device but on the person.

We can therefore remove it without much validation


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| method | `AuthenticationMethodMethod` |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## removePersonAuthenticationMethodWithContext()

removes an `authenticationMethod` from `Person` from currentPerson from authenticated device


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| method | `AuthenticationMethodMethod` |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## signupWithContext()

Creates a new `Person` for a `Device`. Adds that person to the `Device`.

- Can only be done with at least one authenticationMethod
- Can only be done if authentication is not applied on an existing person already.
- Function is wrappable


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| personData | `SignupPersonData` | Data required for creating a `Person`. Can be filled in by the user partly, but also partly automatically |
| **Output** |    |    |



## signupWithPasswordWithContext()

---
publicAuthorization: read, search, execute
---

For now only username/pass is supported due to direct verification

This function makes an authenticationmethod for the device and then signs up by creating a person for it and attaching it to the device.


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| functionContext | `FunctionContext` |  |,| name | string |  |,| handle | string |  |,| pictureImage (optional) | `BackendAsset` |  |,| password | string |  |,| repeatPassword | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |

sends an email or sms, or already confirms in case of emailPassword

core function for `addPersonAuthenticationMethod` and `addDeviceAuthenticatedMethod`


## ðŸ“„ addDeviceAuthenticationMethodConfirm (exported const)

For now, only handles methods `phoneNumber` and `email`

TODO: extrahere the core into `addAuthenticationMethodConfirm` and use it in this one and make also `addPersonAuthenticationMethodConfirm`


## ðŸ“„ addDeviceAuthenticationMethodWithContext (exported const)

returns new function context with added authenticationmethod


## ðŸ“„ addPersonAuthenticationMethodWithContext (exported const)

## ðŸ“„ findAuthenticatedPersonWithHandle (exported const)

## ðŸ“„ isPhoneNumber (exported const)

TODO: Implement this
