  # copyStaticAssets()

uses `getMarkdownReferencePaths` for all markdown files in the `markdown-reader-ui` and copies them into the `markdown-reader-web/public` folder, keeping the original folder structure.

NB: Removes all files in the public folder first.

To get a file from public assets after running this function, you need to get it from the `projectRelativeFilePath`, not the file relative, so you need to render it differently.


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| readerWebPages | `ReaderWebPage`[] |  |,| config (optional) | { operationName?: string, <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## docsGetPages()

| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| basePaths | { projectRelativeBasePath: string, <br />queryPath: string, <br /> }[] |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## docsGetStaticPaths()

Function that tells Next.js what the pages are that need to be statically generated


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| context | `GetStaticPathsContext` |  |,| basePaths | { projectRelativeBasePath: string, <br />queryPath: string, <br /> }[] |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getAllMarkdownReaderPages()

....? I should've commented this

const hasDocs = !!relativeDocsPages.find(

(x) => x.queryPath.toLowerCase() === "docs/readme"

);

if (!hasDocs) {

const hasRootReadme = fs.existsSync(path.join(projectRoot, "README.md"));

if (hasRootReadme) {

relativeDocsPages.unshift({

queryPath: "docs/readme",

filePath: "README.md",

isMenuItem: true,

});

}

}

Gets all pages of a bundle based on the fs and database

Pages it finds:

- operation-readmes
- multiple docs basePaths with all folders and markdown pages there in (`/[project-relative-path]`)
- `/dictionary`
- all markdown model types we have in the db-sdk, optionally, depending on config

Requirements:

- README should always be on top in a folder.
- numbers and extensions are omitted from paths, but still connected to the right file
- If the docs doesn't have a readme, the /docs/readme path shows the root readme.

Does not include AugmentedWord. Just the main pages, not with queries and hashes

Used to generate the menu

| ---------- | -- | -- |
| config (optional) | { manualProjectRoot?: string, <br /> } |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## getChildren()

## getFolderExplorationInfo()

Gets exploration information about a folder

- reads README.md in current folder

## getMarkdownModelPages()

Transforms all your markdown models into  markdown reader pages

Steps:
- Finds all markdown model types from the database config

| **Output** |    |    |



## getReaderTodoPages()

gets all todo pages as markdownreader pages


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| projectRoot | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## markdownReaderGetStaticPaths()

| context | `GetStaticPathsContext` |  |
| **Output** |    |    |



## putReadmeOnTop()

Takes an array of items (`explore` results) and checks them to put readme at the start

DEPRECATED: After writing this, I found that `explore` also has `readmeOnTop` possibility, so this whole thing is not needed


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| - | | |
| **Output** |    |    |



## removeNumberPrefix()

removes number prefixes from a file or folder name. Does not remove extension

## shouldExposeMarkdownFile()

markdown file should only be exposed if it doesn't say `privacy: private` or `isDraft: true` in your frontmatter.

| ---------- | -- | -- |
| parameters | `Frontmatter` |  |
| **Output** | {  }   |    |



## stripReadmeFromFolder()

To get the queryPath, we need to strip the README.md so we get the folder as URL instead of the attached README.md


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| filePath | string |  |
| **Output** | `String`   |    |
