## mdToJsonParse()

makes a markdown parse from a markdown string

TODO: `markdownStringToMarkdownParse` is a better name. First make a refactor script for this, because it is too hard to rename stuff that is used a lot.

TODO: BUG: it doesn't take into account triple backticks! if there is markdown inside of the triple backticks, it can still be seen as main markdown. Triple backticks are stronger!


| Input      |    |    |
| ---------- | -- | -- |
| markdownString | string |  |,| fileName (optional) | string |  |,| config (optional) | `MarkdownParseConfig` |  |
| **Output** |    |    |
