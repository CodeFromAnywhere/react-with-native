 * makes a markdown parse from a markdown string
 *
 * TODO: `markdownStringToMarkdownParse` is a better name. First make a refactor script for this, because it is too hard to rename stuff that is used a lot.
 *
 * TODO: BUG: it doesn't take into account triple backticks! if there is markdown inside of the triple backticks, it can still be seen as main markdown. Triple backticks are stronger!
