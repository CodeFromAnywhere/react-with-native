/**
 * TLDR;EUROS
 *
 * A price is a number indicating the relative cost. Absolute cost is calculated by many other factors
 *
 * For now, we're going to keep it simple: 1 `Price` is equal to 1 Eurocent.
 *
 * Later we can add all kinds of extra conversion:
 *
 * - currency support
 * - king os currency
 * - lower cost for poorer people
 *
 * etc...
 *
 * First we need to start making sales before we can add such complexity.
