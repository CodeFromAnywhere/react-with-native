/**Time

Time can be stored in various ways but in my experience it is, again, best to keep it simple and just have one way to store time.
I can think about this for hours, but my intuition goes towards using the same format as Date.now() because it is a very small format and is easy to read.

It is the amount of ms since 1970.

I could argue to store it in seconds since 1970 since there are few applications of doing ms, but maybe we do, and it's just 30% bigger. No problem.

Therefore, let's store all time values in the format Date.now()
