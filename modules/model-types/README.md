## ðŸ”¹ KeyValueMarkdownModelType

handy model type for storing stuff in a KeyValue Markdown file.
empty lines are omitted

all you need to specify in the kvmd is the key and the value, separated by ":"

NB: there can be a `parent_modelNameSlug` key exposed that should refer to the parent slug





Properties: 

 | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

| operationRelativePath (optional) | string |  |
| categoryStackCalculated  | array |  |
| isHeaderCalculated  | boolean |  |



## ðŸ”¹ Slug

use this for any identifier that's not an Id-type. Usually this is a kebab-case version of a written text, but it can also be a file path, for example.








## ðŸ”¸ SlugModelType

jsonMultiple model



use this model for things with a name that have an unique slug that can be used to identify the model





Properties: 

 | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| slug  | string |  |
| name  | string |  |
| language  | string |  |
| createdAt  | number |  |
| updatedAt  | number |  |

## ðŸ”¹ AugmentedAnyModelType

Properties: 

 | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| operationName  | null |  |
| projectRelativePath  | string |  |
| operationRelativePath (optional) | string |  |
| id  | string |  |



## ðŸ”¹ Id

Should be an unique string
By default, you can use `generateId()` to generate a random string of 16 characters.
If you wish, you can also use any other string, as long as you are sure it's unique.


## Background Info

azAZ09 characters are easy to copy and provide 62 characters.
the goal of an id is to be unique.

the advantage of a random id compared to an numeric id starting with 1 with auto increment is that you can set them up decentralised.

the change of duplicate ids gets bigger once you make them shorter
the change of finding an existing id gets bigger once you make them shorter

An Id with 12 characters would provide 3.22e21 combinations.

What is the change of duplicate ids? This depends on the amount of identifyable items in the data
What is the change of guessing an id? This depends on speed of a brute force attack and the amount of available datapoints. If you can guess 10000 times per second, you can make 864.000.000 guesses. A billion guesses on a dataset of a billion datapoints yields 3226 correct ids on average.

Why make an id short? I don't know if there's an important reason.

All in all, I think we should make ids 24 characters by default. This would make it very easy to store, yet, with more than E42 combinations, make it nearly impossible to get duplication or brute force hits.

An id would look like this:

```
{
"id": "sk2EcW9AkZpksk2EcW9AkZpk"
}
```

Looks good to me!
Don't think about it and just keep it simple.
We can always migrate later to a bigger amount, but I don't see good reason to keep it smaller than this.

1 markdown file will represent 1 MarkdownModelType extended instance

another option could be to parse the markdown file, but to KISS we are going to just return markdown with the full markdown content

TODO: see how this relates to MarkdownFile. Make this very clear!

Simple recursive data structure for hierarchical categories. Should be used to make any category model

text can be in multiple formats.
most texts in data are probably just text
but they can also contain markdown
----
if there is a data model with just a single text and it is clear from the name of the model what it should be, better call it either text or markdown.
