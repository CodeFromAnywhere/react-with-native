/**
 * the idea of admin, is that admin can access all functions
 *
 * the normal user can also access some functions though...
 *
 * for this we need to apify functions automatically.
 *
 * this can be done with frontmatter, something like this would make something an api (with or without authorization layer)
 *
 * ```md
 * ---
 * isApi: true
 * needsAuthToken: boolean
 * ---
 * ```
 *
 * Later, we can also generate the api interface using this information (I already made ap lan for that)
