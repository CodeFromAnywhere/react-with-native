final solution came from here

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47094742/fullscreen-flex-layouts-necessity-of-intermediate-flex-boxes

Unfortunately, I can't seem to hide stuff anymore for some reason on non-mobile. "lg:flex hidden" just doesn't work, just hides!

My elegant solution was to just use visible/invisible and make the mobile layout hover over the invisible one in case of a small screen, it works!
