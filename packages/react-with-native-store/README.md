## createStore()

One function is all you need to make a new store!

Example:


```ts

import { createStore } from "react-with-native-store";
import { TypeA, TypeB } from "your-types";

export const writerInitialValues: {
itemA: TypeA;
itemB: TypeB;
} = {
itemA: "",
itemB: {},
};
export const { useStore, StoreProvider } = createStore(writerInitialValues);


```
