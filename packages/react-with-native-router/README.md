### Router

#### `NB: Experimental package!`

`react-with-native-router` exposes `useNavigation` and `useRouter` which are 1:1 wrappers around `useNavigation` from `react-navigation` and `useRouter` from `next/router` respectively, and provide the most suitable result on web and native.

Creating screens and pages should still be done with `react-navigation` on `react-native` and using the `/pages` folder in `next.js`.


#### Installation

```bash
yarn add react-with-native-router
```

In react-native-apps, you also need to be using [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) in order to use this.


#### Usage

```tsx
import { useRouter, useNavigation } from "react-with-native-router";
import { Button, P } from "react-with-native";
const YourPage = () => {
  // of course, it's better to just use one of them
  // as they have the same functionality (just a different api)
  const router = useRouter();
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  return (
    <Div>
      <Button onClick={() => router.push("/")}>
        <P>Go home</P>
      </Button>

      <Button onClick={() => navigation.navigate("login")}>
        <P>Login</P>
      </Button>
    </Div>
  );
};
```
